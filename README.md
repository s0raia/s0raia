## Hi there! I'm s0raia 👋

I am a **Junior Full-Stack Developer**, **Graphic Designer**, and **Translator** currently navigating a total career pivot. 🧠✨

### 🛠️ Current Status: Housekeeping in Progress
I am currently refactoring my projects and polishing my code to ensure it meets the high standards of **#A11Y** and **Clean Code** that I value. 

Because I’m moving away from messy bootcamp collaboration and toward professional-grade builds, my repositories are temporarily **Private**. 

### 🚀 Projects Coming Soon:
* 🎸 **Chaotic The Harmony** – A full-stack E-commerce & Inventory platform for a fictional ska-punk band.
* 🏎️ **Initial Vroom** – An Initial D-inspired real-time car telemetry simulator.
* 🦖 **Dino-Transit** – A real-time transport app (with a Mesozoic twist).

**If you're a recruiter or collaborator, check back soon—the green tiles are coming!**
